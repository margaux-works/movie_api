    <h1>API Documentation</h1>
    <p>
      The myFlix API is a RESTful service that provides access to a rich
      database of movie information, including details on movies, directors, and
      genres. It also offers user management features, enabling developers to
      integrate user registration, profile updates, and favorite movie lists
      into their applications.
